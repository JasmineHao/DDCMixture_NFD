abstract = {We examine the bidding behavior of firms in the Texas electricity spot market, where bidders submit hourly supply schedules to sell power. We characterize an equilibrium model of bidding and use detailed firm-level data on bids and marginal costs to compare actual bidding behavior to theoretical benchmarks. Firms with large stakes in the market performed close to the theoretical benchmark of static profit maximization. However, smaller firms utilized excessively steep bid schedules significantly deviating from this benchmark. Further analysis suggests that payoff scale has an important effect on firms' willingness and ability to participate in complex, strategic market environments.},

abstract = {The response of aggregate labor supply to various changes in the economic environment is central to many economic issues, including the optimal design of tax policies. Whereas the earlier literature often concluded that aggregate labor supply elasticities were small, we argue that recent work using structural models and micro data credibly supports large aggregate elasticities. We focus on three issues. First, earlier analyses abstracted from several key features, including human capital accumulation, that severely negatively biased estimates of a key preference parameter. Second, failure to understand that aggregate labor supply adjustments can occur along both the hours per worker and employment margins has led economists to misinterpret the implications of preference parameters for aggregate labor supply. Third, structural estimation of models that feature choice along the extensive margin using micro data typically finds large responses.},

abstract = {This paper studies the properties of naive block bootstrap tests that are scaled by zero frequency spectral density estimators (long-run variance estimators). The naive bootstrap is a bootstrap where the formula used in the bootstrap world to compute standard errors is the same as the formula used on the original data. Simulation evidence shows that the naive bootstrap can be much more accurate than the standard normal approximation. The larger the HAC bandwidth, the greater the improvement. This improvement holds for a large number of popular kernels, including the Bartlett kernel, and it holds when the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) bootstrap is used and yet the data are serially correlated. Using recently developed fixed-b asymptotics for HAC robust tests, we provide theoretical results that can explain the finite sample patterns. We show that the block bootstrap, including the special case of the i.i.d. bootstrap, has the same limiting distribution as the fixed-b asymptotic distribution. For the special case of a location model, we provide theoretical results that suggest the naive bootstrap can be more accurate than the standard normal approximation depending on the choice of the bandwidth and the number of finite moments in the data. Our theoretical results lay the foundation for a bootstrap asymptotic theory that is an alternative to the traditional approach based on Edgeworth expansions.},

In the case of pure treatment models, where all observations within clusters are either treated or not, the latter procedure can work remarkably well. The key requirement is that all cluster sizes, regardless of treatment, should be similar. Unfortunately, the analogue of this requirement is not likely to hold for difference-in-differences regressions.

One might thus conduct robust large sample inference as follows: partition the data into q {\&}{\#}8805; 2 groups, estimate the model for each group and conduct a standard t-test with the resulting q parameter estimators. This results in valid inference as long as the groups are chosen in a way that ensures the parameter estimators to be asymptotically independent, unbiased and Gaussian of possibly different variances.

An introductory section defines semiparametric models more precisely and reviews the techniques used to derive the large-sample properties of the corresponding estimation methods. The next section describes a number of weak restrictions on error distributions — conditional mean, conditional quantile, conditional symmetry, independence, and index restrictions — and show how they can be used to derive identifying restrictions on the distributions of observables. This general discussion is followed by a survey of a number of specific estimators proposed for particular econometric models, and the chapter concludes with a brief account of applications of these methods in practice.},

It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape restrictions on distributions, and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature.},

Conventional wisdom based on studies in the 1980s and 1990s has long held that the analysis of micro data leads one to conclude that aggregate labor supply elasticities are quite small. In this paper we argue that this conventional wisdom does not hold up to empirically reasonable and relevant extensions of simple life cycle models that served as the basis for these conclusions. In particular, we show that several pieces of conventional wisdom fail in the presence of human capital accumulation or labor supply decisions that allow for adjustment along both the extensive and intensive margin.

abstract = {Models of heterogeneous firms with selection into export market participation generically exhibit aggregate trade elasticities that vary across country-pairs. Only when heterogeneity is assumed Pareto-distributed do all elasticities collapse into a unique elasticity, estimable with a gravity equation. This paper provides a theory-consistent methodology for quantifying country-pair specific aggregate elasticities when moving away from Pareto, i.e. when gravity does not hold. Combining two firm-level customs datasets for which we observe French and Chinese individual sales on the same destination market over the 2000–2006 period, we are able to estimate all the components of the bilateral aggregate elasticity: i) the demand-side parameter that governs the intensive margin and ii) the supply side parameters that drive the extensive margin. These components are then used to calculate theoretical predictions of bilateral aggregate elasticities over the whole set of destinations, and how those elasticities decompose into different margins. Our predictions fit well with econometric estimates, supporting our view that micro-data is a key element in the quantification of aggregate trade elasticities.},

abstract = {In the past few decades multistore retailers, especially those with 100 or more stores, have experienced substantial growth. At the same time, there is widely reported public outcry over the impact of these chain stores on other retailers and local communities. This paper develops an empirical model to assess the impact of chain stores on other discount retailers and to quantify the size of the scale economies within a chain. The model has two key features. First, it allows for flexible competition patterns among all players. Second, for chains, it incorporates the scale economies that arise from operating multiple stores in nearby regions. In doing so, the model relaxes the commonly used assumption that entry in different markets is independent. The lattice theory is exploited to solve this complicated entry game among chains and other discount retailers in a large number of markets. It is found that the negative impact of Kmart's presence on Wal-Mart's profit was much stronger in 1988 than in 1997, while the opposite is true for the effect of Wal-Mart's presence on Kmart's profit. Having a chain store in a market makes roughly 50{\%} of the discount stores unprofitable. Wal-Mart's expansion from the late 1980s to the late 1990s explains about 40–50{\%} of the net change in the number of small discount stores and 30–40{\%} for all other discount stores. Scale economies were important for Wal-Mart, but less so for Kmart, and the magnitude did not grow proportionately with the chains' sizes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study how occupation (or industry) tradability shapes local labor-market adjustment to immigration. Theoretically, we derive a simple condition under which the arrival of foreign-born labor into a region crowds native-born workers out of (or into) immigrant-intensive jobs, thus lowering (or raising) relative wages in these occupations, and explain why this process differs within tradable versus within nontrad-able activities. Using data for U.S. commuting zones over the period 1980 to 2012, we find that consistent with our theory a local influx of immigrants crowds out employment of native-born workers in more relative to less immigrant-intensive nontradable jobs, but has no such effect within tradable occupations. Further analysis of occupation labor payments is consistent with adjustment to immigration within tradables occurring more through changes in output (versus changes in prices) when compared to adjustment within nontradables, thus confirming our model's theoretical mechanism. We then use an extended quantitative model to interpret the magnitudes of our reduced-form estimates and to aggregate up the consequences of counterfactual changes in U.S. immigration from the region-occupation level to the region-level-Hansberg for helpful comments.

Of the various sensitivity checks we carry out, controlling for the increase in labor quality and labor hours, as proxied by the rising real wage, has the largest (downward) effect on the productivity estimates. We further document that new entrants are a particularly dynamic force and that firms experience large productivity declines before exiting from the sample. Overall, net entry contributes roughly half to total TFP growth. Aggregate productivity growth, however, is tempered by a much lower effect of reallocation of inputs towards higher productivity firms, compared to the U.S. benchmark.},

Demand and price forecasting play an important role in determining prices and scheduling load in dynamic pricing environments. This allows different forms of dynamic pricing policies to different markets and customers depending on customers' willingness to pay. Consumers' willingness to pay for electricity services is also necessary in setting price limits depending on the demand and demand response curve.

In our framework, a consumer interacts with a sequence of firms in a stationary Gaussian setting. Each firm relies on the consumer's current score-modeled as a linear aggregate of past quantity signals discounted exponentially-to learn about her preferences and to set prices. In equilibrium, the consumer reduces her demand to drive average prices below the no-information benchmark. Firms' learning-and thus, their ability to price discriminate-is maximized by scores that overweigh signals relative to Bayes' rule when observing disaggregated data. In markets with high average willingness to pay, the benefits from low prices dominate the losses from better tailored prices, and thus consumers want to be tracked. Finally, hidden scores-those only observed by firms-reduce demand sensitivity, increase expected prices, and reduce expected quantities. the seminar participants at Bilkent, Boston University, Chicago, Cowles, Duke, Har-vard, Indiana, INFORMS, MIT, Miami, Napoli, Penn, Princeton, Texas, and Toulouse for their helpful discussions.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. This paper provides an economic and legal theory of harm applicable to the case against Google in Europe over search bias. So far, no clear legal and economic theory has yet been delineated by the European Commission, nor consensus in the literature has emerged with regard to the theory of foreclosure that could support the case, or with regard to the specific form of abuse of dominance applicable under European law. The paper shows that the law and economics of tying applies to search bias. From a legal standpoint, it is not necessary to rely on the more formalistic elements of Article 102 TFEU, or to characterize Google as an essential facility, in order to find a valid legal theory of harm. We show that Google's conduct of linking its proprietary vertical (or specialized) search platforms to its horizontal (or general) search platform through visual prominence, as it has done with Google Shopping, fits within the legal boundaries of tying under European law. From an economic perspective, we show that the two-sided nature of both horizontal and vertical search provides compelling reasons why foreclosure of competition may be profitable, and why the single monopoly profit theorem may fail in this context. As we show in the paper, by tying vertical search to general search through visual prominence, Google can attract additional advertisers on its vertical search platform that would have possibly advertised on competing vertical search platforms without a tie. The effect of tying is a restriction on competition in vertical search that deserves antitrust scrutiny.},

abstract = {We give a general construction of debiased/locally robust/orthogonal (LR) moment functions for GMM, where the derivative with respect to first step nonparametric estimation is zero and equivalently first step estimation has no effect on the influence function. This construction consists of adding an estimator of the influence function adjustment term for first step nonparametric estimation to identifying or original moment conditions. We also give numerical methods for estimating LR moment functions that do not require an explicit formula for the adjustment term. LR moment conditions have reduced bias and so are important when the first step is machine learning. We derive LR moment conditions for dynamic discrete choice based on first step machine learning estimators of conditional choice probabilities. We provide simple and general asymptotic theory for LR estimators based on sample splitting. This theory uses the additive decomposition of LR moment conditions into an identifying condition and a first step influence adjustment. Our conditions require only mean square consistency and a few (generally either one or two) readily interpretable rate conditions. LR moment functions have the advantage of being less sensitive to first step estimation. Some LR moment functions are also doubly robust meaning they hold if one first step is incorrect. We give novel classes of doubly robust moment functions and characterize double robustness. For doubly robust estimators our asymptotic theory only requires one rate condition.},

The model embodies plant-level heterogeneity in export profits, uncertainty about the determinants of future profits, and market entry costs for new exporters. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain estimator, we fit this model to plant-level panel data on three Colombian manufacturing industries. We ob-tain profit function and sunk entry cost coefficients, and use them to simulate export responses to shifts in the exchange-rate process and several types of export subsidies. In each case, the aggregate export response depends on entry costs, expectations about the exchange rate process, prior exporting experience, and producer heterogeneity. Ex-port revenue subsidies are far more effective at stimulating exports than policies that subsidize entry costs.},

We develop a dynamic model in which a firm's exports in a market may depend on how similar the market is to the firm's home country (gravity) and to its previous export destinations (extended gravity). Given the large number of export paths from which forward-looking firms may choose, we use a moment inequality approach to estimate our model. Our estimates indicate that sharing similarities with a prior export destination in terms of geographic location, language, and income per capita jointly reduces the cost of foreign market entry by 69{\%} to 90{\%}. Reductions due to geographic location (25{\%} to 38{\%}) and language (29{\%} to 36{\%}) have the largest effect. Extended gravity thus has a large impact on export entry costs.

Achieving this goal does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression coefficients, average treatment effects, average lifts, and demand or supply elasticities. In fact, estimates of such causal parameters obtained via naively plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave very poorly due to the regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools. Specifically, we can form an orthogonal score for the target low-dimensional parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The score is then used to build a de-biased estimator of the target parameter which typically will converge at the fastest possible 1/root(n) rate and be approximately unbiased and normal, and from which valid confidence intervals for these parameters of interest may be constructed. The resulting method thus could be called a "double ML" method because it relies on estimating primary and auxiliary predictive models. In order to avoid overfitting, our construction also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross-fitting. This allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forest, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregators of these methods.},

Finally, we show that our proof technique generates non-trivial bounds on the prediction norm of the estimation error of the cross-validated Lasso estimator even if the assumption of the Gaussian noise fails; in particular, the prediction norm of the estimation error is with high-probability bounded from above up to a constant by {\$}(s\backslashlog{\^{}}2(p n)/n){\^{}}{\{}1/4{\}}{\$} under mild regularity conditions.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Scraped Data as a new source of micro-price information for the study of sticky prices. Scraped data are collected from online retailers and have a unique advantage in sampling frequency, product details, and country availability. Using daily prices of 80 thousand products in four countries, between 2007 and 2010, I present three new empirical results. First, the distribution of the size of price changes is bimodal, with few changes close to zero percent. Second, hazard functions are hump-shaped, with the probability of a price change increasing for the first 40 to 90 days. Third, there is daily synchronization in the timing of price changes among closely competing brands. These findings are consistent with adjustment costs and strategic interactions in price-setting decisions.},

abstract = {Inverse problems can be described as functional equations where the value of the function is known or easily estimable but the argument is unknown. Many problems in econometrics can be stated in the form of inverse problems where the argument itself is a function. For example, consider a nonlinear regression where the functional form is the object of interest. One can readily estimate the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given a vector of instruments. From this estimate, one would like to recover the unknown functional form. This chapter provides an introduction to the estimation of the solution to inverse problems. It focuses mainly on integral equations of the first kind. Solving these equations is particularly challenging as the solution does not necessarily exist, may not be unique, and is not continuous. As a result, a regularized (or smoothed) solution needs to be implemented. We review different regularization methods and study the properties of the estimator. Integral equations of the first kind appear, for example, in the generalized method of moments when the number of moment conditions is infinite, and in the nonparametric estimation of instrumental variable regressions. In the last section of this chapter, we investigate integral equations of the second kind, whose solutions may not be unique but are continuous. Such equations arise when additive models and measurement error models are estimated nonparametrically. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We consider estimation and inference in panel data models with additive unobserved individual specific heterogeneity in a high dimensional setting. The setting allows the number of time varying regressors to be larger than the sample size. To make informative estimation and inference feasible, we require that the overall contribution of the time varying variables after eliminating the individual specific heterogeneity can be captured by a relatively small number of the available variables whose identities are unknown. This restriction allows the problem of estimation to proceed as a variable selection problem. Importantly, we treat the individual specific heterogeneity as fixed effects which allows this heterogeneity to be related to the observed time varying variables in an unspecified way and allows that this heterogeneity may be non-zero for all individuals. Within this framework, we provide procedures that give uniformly valid inference over a fixed subset of parameters in the canonical linear fixed effects model and over coefficients on a fixed vector of endogenous variables in panel data instrumental variables models with fixed effects and many instruments. An input to developing the properties of our proposed procedures is the use of a variant of the Lasso estimator that allows for a grouped data structure where data across groups are independent and dependence within groups is unrestricted. We provide formal conditions within this structure under which the proposed Lasso variant selects a sparse model with good approximation properties. We present simulation results in support of the theoretical developments and illustrate the use of the methods in an application aimed at estimating the effect of gun prevalence on crime rates.},

The model generates the full class of import demand systems consistent with Ricardian theory, and, hence, captures its full macroeconomic implications. In particular, our framework formalizes Ricardo's insight—absent from the canonical Ricardian model—that countries gain more from trade partners with relatively dissimilar technology. Incorporating this insight into the calculations of macro counterfactuals entails a simple correction to self-trade shares. Our framework enables general aggregation results which tie micro optimization to macro demand systems and guide counterfactual analysis based on micro estimates. Our quantitative application to a multi-sector trade model suggests that countries specialized in low correlation sectors have 40 percent higher gains from trade relative to countries specialized in high correlation sectors. After accounting for correlation, the model predicts that lower trade costs for imports from China, rather than Canada, have the largest impact on real wages in the United States.},

abstract = {The paper explores the role of price or quantity leadership in facilitating collusion. It extends the standard analysis of tacit collusion by allowing firms to make their strategic choices either simultaneously or sequentially. It is shown that price leadership indeed facilitates collusion by making it easier to punish deviations by the leader. In case of pure Bertrand competition, price leadership restores the scope for (perfect) collusion in markets where collusion would not be sustainable otherwise. When firms face asymmetric costs or offer differentiated products, price leadership can also enhance the profitability of collusion—in case of asymmetric costs, the less efficient firm must act as the leader. Finally, such leadership is less effective in case of Cournot competition since, following an aggressive deviation by the leader, the follower would rather limit its own output, making it more difficult to punish the deviation. Still, quantity leadership may enhance collusion when it is already somewhat effective in a simultaneous move setting.},

In their model, this price leadership facilitates collusion under asymmetric information. In equilibrium, the leader earns higher profits than the follower. Nonetheless, if information is sufficiently asymmetric, the less informed firm prefers to follow the better-informed firm, so the leader can emerge endogenously. The authors show that the follower can benefit from price rigidity so that prices may be changed infrequently. They also show that overall welfare may be lower under collusive price leadership than under overt collusion. Copyright 1990 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {We document the costs of job loss to displaced workers over the business cycle and its sources using administrative data from Germany. Losses in annual earnings in Germany after displacement are large, persistent, and highly cyclical, nearly doubling in size during economic downturns. We show that part of these losses and their cyclicality is driven by unemployment. As a result, unemployment insurance (UI) plays an important role in buffering the effect of job displacements, especially in recessions. However, the longer-tem earnings losses we find are mainly driven by declines in wages, and hence UI benefits do little to offset lifetime losses in earnings. Preliminary results suggest that an important factor behind the long-lasting declines in wages and their cyclicality are changes in employer characteristics, as workers switch to smaller paying firms after job displacement, in particular in recessions.},

abstract = {We revisit the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter $\theta$0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters $\eta$0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for $\eta$0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate $\eta$0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating $\eta$0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of $\theta$0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of $\eta$0 into estimating equations for $\theta$0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N −1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of reg-ularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest $\theta$0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate $\theta$0, and (2) making use of cross-fitting which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N −1/2-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average 1 Note: Replication files in programming language R are available at https://github.com/VC2015/DMLonGitHub/ 2 CCDDHNR treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting.

The proposed framework combines Bayesian inference with partial identification results. The method is applicable to models with finite space of observed states. We demonstrate the method on Rust's model of bus engine replacement. The estimation experiments show that the parametric assumptions about the distribution of the unobserved states can have a considerable effect on the estimates of per-period payoffs. At the same time, the effect of these assumptions on counterfactual conditional choice probabilities can be small for most of the observed states.},

Allowable heterogeneity across individuals include individual-specific time trends, individual-specific fixed effects and time-specific effects. The estimator is fully parametric, computationally convenient, and more precise than the single equation estimator. For fixed N as T approaches infinity, the estimator converges to a function of Brownian motions and the Wald statistic for testing a set of linear constraints has a limiting chi-square distribution. The estimator also has a Gaussian sequential limit distribution that is obtained first by letting T go to infinity then letting N go to infinity. In a series of Monte Carlo experiments, we find that the asymptotic distribution theory provides a reasonably close approximation to the exact finite sample distribution. We use panel dynamic OLS to estimate coefficients of the long-run money demand function from a panel of 19 countries with annual observations that span from 1957 to 1996. The estimated income elasticity is 1.08 (asymptotic s.e.=0.26) and the estimated interest rate semi-elasticity is-0.02 (asymptotic s.e.=0.01).},

Your use of the JSTOR archive indicates your acceptance of the Terms {\&} Conditions of Use, available at This paper develops a regression limit theory for nonstationary panel data with large numbers of cross section (n) and time series (T) observations. The limit theory allows for both sequential limits, wherein T coo followed by n-* oo, and joint limits where T, n-c00 simultaneously; and the relationship between these multidimensional limits is explored. The panel structures considered allow for no time series cointegration, heterogeneous cointegration, homogeneous cointegration, and near-homogeneous cointegration. The paper explores the existence of long-run average relations between integrated panel vectors when there is no individual time series cointegration and when there is heterogeneous cointegration. These relations are parameterized in terms of the matrix regression coefficient of the long-run average covariance matrix. In the case of homogeneous and near homogeneous cointegrating panels, a panel fully modified regression estimator is developed and studied. The limit theory enables us to test hypotheses about the long run average parameters both within and between subgroups of the full population.},

We discuss likelihood ratio tests of cointegration rank and find the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics. We characterize the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations and formulate tests of structural hypotheses about these relations. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the $\chi$ {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} distribution.

A convenient two-step estimator is suggested where in the first step all individual specific parameters are estimated, whereas in the second step the long-run parameters are estimated from a pooled least- squares regression. The two-step estimator and related test procedures can easily be modified to account for contemporaneously correlated errors, a feature that is often encountered in multi-country studies.

It extends the empirical models of dynamic oligopoly entry by allowing for spatially interdependent entry and introducing ma-chine learning tools to infer market divisions from data. The results suggest that preemptive incentives are important in chain stores' location decisions and that they lead to loss of production efficiency.

abstract = {Internal market structure analysis infers brand positions in an attribute space from preference and choice data, given a market in which consumers have heterogeneous tastes for attributes. Previous market structure models have adopted a static framework (e.g., Elrod 1988, Chintagunta 1994, Elrod and Keane 1995). Furthermore, they assumed that consumer perceptions of brand attributes do not vary across consumers. Yet, these approaches may render inaccurate representations of market structure if there is state dependence in consumer choice behavior. This paper attempts to incorporate consumer choice dynamics into market structure models by specifying the source of choice dynamics explicitly. In particular, the process by which past purchases affect current choices is modeled in a framework which captures both consumer habit persistence and variety seeking behavior. More specifically, consumer preferences for brand attributes are modeled to depend on the attributes of brands bought on the previous purchase occasion. Furthermore, the modeling approach adopted incorporates heterogeneity in both consumer preferences and perceptions of brand attributes. The audience of this paper includes practitioners and academics interested in understanding consumer choice processes and inferring market structure from consumer choice data. The proposed models are estimated on Nielsen scanner panel data for margarine, peanut butter, yogurt, and liquid detergent using simulated maximum likelihood techniques. The empirical results suggest that accounting for choice dynamics improves both in-sample and out-of-sample fit. The results indicate that the average consumer is habit persistent in all the product categories studied. This result is consistent with the findings of Kannan and Sanchez (1994), who conducted an aggregate analysis of consumer variety seeking behavior across product categories. However, the results obtained in this paper suggest that consumers are heterogeneous with respect to the processes by which past purchases affect current purchases. These results provide strong evidence for habit persistence and variety seeking in brand attributes to be the behavioral source of consumer choice dynamics in food categories. Thus, consumer tastes (utility weights) seem to be affected by the attributes of the brands consumed in the past. Given the empirical result that a large proportion of consumers are habit persistent, this suggests that tastes are reinforced by the brand attributes consumed in the past. The empirical results also show that not accounting for state dependence in market structure models for panel data may produce misleading results, that is, depending on consumer behavior patterns, models that do not account for state dependence may distort the true nature of competition among brands. More specifically, the results confirm the expectation that if there is habit persistence, that is, if consumer tastes are reinforced by attributes of brands consumed in the past, models that do not capture this choice dynamics will overestimate the distance between (similar) brands. Furthermore, the policy experiments conducted suggest that (1) static models overestimate the short-run impact of a price cut on the sales of the brand on promotion, (2) price cuts hurt the sales of the more similar brands more, and (3) free samples affect relatively less similar brands the most. Finally, this paper studies variety seeking and habit persistence across brands over purchase occasions. However, variety seeking behavior may also involve the purchase of a portfolio of brands or items at a purchase occasion. Consumers may buy multiple items knowing that prior to the next trip they may want to consume different items (Simanson 1990, Walsh 1995). This type of behavior can be modeled within the context of dynamic expected utility maximization with forward-looking consumers. The development and estimation of market structure models that include forward-looking consumers who maximize expected-utility over a planning horizon, incorporating their future tastes and needs, and shopping for an inventory of brands, remain an important future research issue.},

Our paper reexamines this conventional wisdom and characterizes optimal collusion without any prior restriction on the class of strategies. We stress that firms can credibly agree on retaliation schemes that maximally punish even the most efficient firm. This implies that whenever collusion is sustainable under cost symmetry, some collusion is also sustainable under cost asymmetry; efficient collusion, however, remains more difficult to sustain when costs are asymmetric. Finally, we show that in the presence of side payments cost asymmetry facilitates collusion. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

The bromine cartel in the U.S. used the threat of price wars to provide individual firms with an incentive to participate in the cartel. An examination of the historical incidents leading up to each of the six bromine price wars suggests that imperfect monitoring problems--the inability to distinguish between random shocks and real cheating--did contribute to the occurrence of some price wars. A comparison of the qualitative characteristics of price wars with the optimal punishment finds that in four cases the initial price cut and the duration of the price war were similar, as predicted. However, those price wars were relatively mild, and did not approach the Cournot reversion levels, let alone more severe punishments which had been contemplated. Two other price wars began right after publicly announced violations of the collusive agreement. These price wars were the result of disagreements among participant firms regarding the distribution of rents generated by collusion. These price wars lasted longer, and prices fell much further. These two price wars are better understood as breakdowns in collusions than as equilibrium punishments.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of estimating the normal-form payoff parameters of a simultaneous, discrete game where the realization of such payoffs is not common knowledge. The paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, by making a comparison with the complete information case it formally describes a set of conditions under which allowing for private information in payoffs facilitates the identification of various features of the game. Second, focusing on the incomplete information case it presents an estimation procedure based on the equilibrium properties of the game that relies on weak semiparametric assumptions and relatively flexible information structures which allow players to condition their beliefs on signals whose exact distribution function is unknown to the researcher. The proposed estimators recover unobserved beliefs by solving a semiparametric sample analog of the population Bayesian-Nash equilibrium conditions. The asymptotic features of such estimators are studied for the case in which the distribution of unobserved shocks is known and the case in which it is unknown. In both instances equilibrium uniqueness is assumed to hold only in a neighborhood of the true parameter value and for a subset Z of realizations of the signals. Multiple equilibria are allowed elsewhere in the parameter space and no equilibrium selection theory is involved. Extensions to games where beliefs are conditioned on unobservables as well as general games with many players and actions are also discussed. An empirical application of a simple capital investment game is included. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

I characterize the extremal-interim incentive efficient-equilibria. In these equilibria, the partners generally "start small," and the level of interaction grows over time. The types of players separate quickly. Further, cooperation between "good" types is viable regardless of how pessimistic the players are about each other initially. The quick nature of separation in an extremal equilibrium contrasts with the outcome selected by a strong renegotiation criterion (as studied in Watson (1999, J. Econ. Theory 85, 52-90).

abstract = {In this paper we survey several cross-section studies of cartels and a large sample of case studies of cartels in individual industries. We compare the findings of these studies of cartel activity from the 1800s through the 1980s with the characteristics of a sample of international cartels from the 1990s, and present preliminary evidence on whether the stylized facts regarding industry characteristics for historical cartels also hold for contemporary cartels. The hard lesson learned from our survey of the empirical work is that it is difficult to generalize about cartel behavior. Our examination of cartel duration concludes that cartels are neither short-lived nor long-lived; they are both. Similarly, our analysis of the effect of cartels on prices and profitability finds that there is enormous variance in cartel success at raising price to the joint-profit maximizing level. In our examination of cartel breakdowns we find, as suggested by recent theoretical literature, that cheating is a common cause. Occurring even more frequently, however, are entry, external shocks, and bargaining problems, suggesting that these issues should be given deeper consideration in future work. Stigler's hypothesis that large customers contribute to cartel breakdowns is borne out in a few case studies. But there appear to be more cases in our sample in which large customers help to stabilize the cartel. Only the oldest of suppositions, that highly concentrated industries are more prone to cartelization, seems to hold true across studies. Our inability to find more commonality among these studies and among cartels does not simply reflect our ignorance of cartel operations or secrecy on the part of cartels (or the different methodological approaches covered in this survey). Rather, it reflects the innumerable possibilities for organizing a successful cartel, and the interdependence of those factors determining cartel success.},

abstract = {How do movements in the distribution of income and wealth affect the macroeconomy? We analyze this question using a calibrated version of the stochastic growth model with partially uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and movements in aggregate productivity. Our main finding is that, in the stationary stochastic equilibrium, the behavior of the macroeconomic aggregates can be almost perfectly described using only the mean of the wealth distribution. This result is robust to substantial changes in both parameter values and model specification. Our benchmark model, whose only difference from the representative‐agent framework is the existence of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, displays far less cross‐sectional dispersion and skewness in wealth than U.S. data. However, an extension that relies on a small amount of heterogeneity in thrift does succeed in replicating the key features of the wealth data. Furthermore, this extension features aggregate time series that depart significantly from permanent income behavior.},

In the second stage our estimator minimizes a minimum distance criterion that measures the divergence between the nonparametric conditional distribution function and a model implied simulated semiparametric counterpart.

We estimate the expected value function by kernel smoothing and derive its pointwise distribution theory.

abstract = {Alcohol abuse is widely blamed for the very high rate of male mortality in Russia. I specify and estimate a simple structural model of the demand for alcohol that incorporates two key features of the Russian context. First, alcohol use – particularly incidents of heavy drinking – often involves friends and (male) family members. Second, there is strong habit persistence in alcohol use: depending on the degree of forward-looking behavior by consumers, responses to a tax policy will depend on beliefs about the future path of prices. I estimate the model using panel data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS), and two alternative sources of variation in alcohol prices: a 2011 change that shifted the trend in the rate of growth of the excise tax for alcohol, and regional variation in alcohol regulations over the 1995-2014 period. To obtain direct information on peer use of alcohol, I exploit the clustered design of the RLMS, which enables me to find close neighbors for nearly all sample members. The estimation results confirm that both peer influence and habit persistence are critical determinants of the longer-run response of alcohol demand to price changes. One third of the predicted 30{\%} reduction in the rate of heavy drinking caused by a 50{\%} permanent increase in vodka prices, for example, is attributed to the social multiplier effect that emerges as groups of friends jointly reduce their consumption. Finally, I use the RLMS data to relate patterns of heavy drinking to mortality. The estimates imply that permanent increases in alcohol prices would yield significant reductions in male mortality.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In our model, retail firms are vertically and horizontally differentiated, compete in prices, make investments to improve the quality of their businesses, and decide to exit or to continue in the market. The model extends in two important ways the entry-exit model estimated in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007). First, it includes firm size and growth as endogenous variables. And second, the empirical model has two sources of permanent unobserved heterogeneity: local-market heterogeneity and firm heterogeneity. This allows the researcher to control for potentially important sources of bias when using firm panel data with many local markets and several time periods.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the literature devoted to studying markets for health care services and health insurance. There has been tremendous growth and progress in this field. A tremendous amount of new research has been done since the publication of the first volume of this Handbook. In addition, there has been increasing development and use of frontier industrial organization methods. We begin by examining research on the determinants of market structure, considering both static and dynamic models. We then model the strategic determination of prices between health insurers and providers where insurers market their products to consumers based, in part, on the quality and breadth of their provider network. We then review the large empirical literature on the strategic determination of hospital prices through the lens of this model. Variation in the quality of health care clearly can have large welfare consequences. We therefore also describe the theoretical and empirical literature on the impact of market structure on quality of health care. The chapter then moves on to consider competition in health insurance markets and physician services markets. We conclude by considering vertical restraints and monopsony power.},

Entry costs faced by potential entrants, fixed costs faced by incumbent producers, and the toughness of short-run price competition are all found to be important determinants of long-run firm values, firm turnover, and market structure. Estimates for the dentist industry allow the entry cost to differ for geographic markets that were designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas and in which entry was subsidized. The estimated mean entry cost is 11 percent lower in these markets. Using simulations, we compare entry-cost versus fixed-cost subsidies and find that entry-cost subsidies are less expensive per additional firm.},

In industries where fixed costs are an important de-terminant of market structure, this static analysis ignores the dynamic effects of the regulation on entry, investment, and market power. I evaluate the welfare costs of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on the U.S. Portland cement industry, accounting for these effects through a dynamic model of oligopoly in the tradition of Ericson and Pakes (1995). Using the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I recover the entire cost structure of the industry, including the distributions of sunk entry costs and capacity adjustment costs. My primary finding is that the Amendments have significantly increased the sunk cost of entry, leading to a loss of between {\$}810M and {\$}3.2B in product market surplus. A static analysis misses the welfare penalty on consumers, and obtains the wrong sign of the welfare effects on incumbent firms.},

A simple transformation of the demand function allows us to identify not only the demand parameters but also the parameters of the goodwill production function. We reconstruct the unobserved goodwill levels using these parameters and past advertising levels.We restrict our attention to Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) strategies which are functions of payoff relevant state variables.Without imposing further restrictions on the dynamic competitive environment,weinvestigate the relationship between observed advertising strategies—which are assumed to be MPE—and payoff relevant state variables by means of several reduced form specifications. The most important determinant of advertising intensity turns out to be goodwill. We demonstrate that controlling for an advertising campaign significantly improves the explanatory power of the model.},

Based on this, we propose a new two‐step estimator for these models; interestingly, the first step of our estimator involves solving a linear program that is identical to the classic assignment (two‐sided matching) game of Shapley and Shubik (1971). The application of convex‐analytic tools to dynamic discrete‐choice models and the connection with two‐sided matching models is new in the literature. Monte Carlo results demonstrate the good performance of this estimator, and we provide an empirical application based on Rust's (1987) bus engine replacement model.},

abstract = {Much is happening in the automotive industry and new models are in the market or are expected to be available soon. At the same time, environmental awareness, new regulations for increased fuel efficiency, and the need to diminish greenhouse gas emissions make small vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles more competitive. As a consequence, vehicle characteristics and consumer decisions will change rapidly in the short and medium run. Accounting for the dynamic of the problem is important to correctly forecast green vehicle acceptance and to evaluate eco-friendly policies. This paper proposes a generalized dynamic discrete choice approach that models purchase behavior and forecasts future preferences in a finite time horizon setting. The framework allows one-time purchases, repeated purchases, univariate and multivariate diffusion processes that capture the evolution of vehicle characteristics and dynamics in the market conditions. The models proposed are estimated using stated preference data collected in Maryland. Results show that the formulation with repeated purchases successfully captures changes in the market shares, and that the multivariate diffusion process adopted to model the evolution of fuel prices further improves both model fit and the ability to recover peaks in demand. The estimated coefficients have been applied to test different policy scenarios, including changes in fuel prices, vehicle purchase prices, and improvements of car characteristics. These policies have a high impact on the adoption of electric cars and on their diffusion in the marketplace.},

abstract = {Kernel density estimation and kernel regression are powerful but computationally expensive techniques: a direct evaluation of kernel density estimates at {\$}M{\$} evaluation points given {\$}N{\$} input sample points requires a quadratic {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(MN){\$} operations, which is prohibitive for large scale problems. For this reason, approximate methods such as binning with Fast Fourier Transform or the Fast Gauss Transform have been proposed to speed up kernel density estimation. Among these fast methods, the Fast Sum Updating approach is an attractive alternative, as it is an exact method and its speed is independent from the input sample and the bandwidth. Unfortunately, this method, based on data sorting, has for the most part been limited to the univariate case. In this paper, we revisit the fast sum updating approach and extend it in several ways. Our main contribution is to extend it to the general multivariate case for general input data and rectilinear evaluation grid. Other contributions include its extension to a wider class of kernels, including the triangular, cosine and Silverman kernels, and its combination with a fast approximate k-nearest-neighbors bandwidth for multivariate datasets. Our numerical tests of multivariate regression and density estimation confirm the speed, accuracy and stability of the method. We hope this paper will renew interest for the fast sum updating approach and help solve large scale practical density estimation and regression problems.},

abstract = {This note introduces an estimation technique based on the optimality conditions from dynamic models. The technique has at least two virtues; i)it is easy to implement, and ii) it is logically consistent with the underlying model (and hence can be used to analyze the model's implications). It is driven by the assumption that agents perceptions of the distribution of the discounted value of future net cash flows are rational in the sense that they are, at least on average, consistent with the realizations of those net cash flows. Since this assumption is used extensively in applied work, our estimator should be useful in a wide variety of settings. We are, however, particularly interested in using it to estimate parameters from dynamic models of oligopolistic industries. Consequently after a brief introduction to the estimator, we will focus on how our estimator can help analyze behavior in oligopolistic industries. In this context there are three issues that motivated the development of our estimator. First, the first order conditions currently used in empirical models of markets are typically the equations from a static Nash equilibrium (in either prices or in quantities). For these equations to be an accurate description of pricing (or quantity setting) behavior the conditional distribution of the firm's future states, conditional on whatever investment decisions are made in the interim, does not depend on the price (or quantity) decision being studied. There are many important examples in which current prices or quantities will have independent impacts on future states, as well as on current profits, and in these cases the logic behind the static price or quantity setting equation falls apart. Examples include models with: learning by doing; either durable, experience, addictive, or network goods; and collusion. Our estimation technique can allow for any (or all) of these extensions, and nests the standard static models as testable special cases. * Yale University and the NBER, and Harvard University and the NBER, respectively.

abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic programming (DP) model of an electric utility's optimal policy for operating a nuclear power plant (NPP). The utility chooses the level of capacity utilization of the NPP as a function of signals about the NPP's current operating state. In each period the utility must determine whether or not to operate the reactor, or shut it down for preventive maintenance or refueling, or to permanently close the plant. Maintenance performed during periodic refueling outages partially ``regenerates'' the NPP, reducing the risk of unplanned forced outages in succeeding periods. Using monthly data on U.S. NPPs in the post-TMI era we estimate parameters of the utility's profit function, the failure processes that lead to unplanned forced outages, and the parameters governing the duration of refueling outages. These parameters imply an endogenous distribution of operating spells and capacity utilization levels that depend on the NPP's age, signals the operator receives about the NPP's current operating state, and the duration since last refueling. The estimates of the DP model reveal that utilities appear responsive to NRC regulation insofar as they impute a very high cost to unplanned and forced outages. Utilities are also highly averse to causing unnecessary wear and tear on their NPP's caused by stop/start operation of their NPP's including planned and unplanned outages. Overall, the DP model yields very accurate predictions of nuclear power generation including the impact of the relatively rare event of NPP decommissionings.},

abstract = {Internal market structure analysis infers brand positions in an$\backslash$nattribute space from preference and choice data, given a market in which$\backslash$nconsumers have heterogeneous tastes for attributes. Previous market$\backslash$nstructure models have adopted a static framework (e.g., Elrod 1988,$\backslash$nChintagunta 1994, Elrod and Keane 1995). Furthermore, they assumed that$\backslash$nconsumer perceptions of brand attributes do not vary across consumers.$\backslash$nYet, these approaches may render inaccurate representations of market$\backslash$nstructure if there is state dependence in consumer choice behavior. This$\backslash$npaper attempts to incorporate consumer choice dynamics into market$\backslash$nstructure models by specifying the source of choice dynamics explicitly.$\backslash$nIn particular, the process by which past purchases affect current$\backslash$nchoices is modeled in a framework which captures both consumer habit$\backslash$npersistence and variety seeking behavior. More specifically, consumer$\backslash$npreferences for brand attributes are modeled to depend on the attributes$\backslash$nof brands bought on the previous purchase occasion. Furthermore, the$\backslash$nmodeling approach adopted incorporates heterogeneity in both consumer$\backslash$npreferences and perceptions of brand attributes. The audience of this$\backslash$npaper includes practitioners and academics interested in understanding$\backslash$nconsumer choice processes and inferring market structure from consumer$\backslash$nchoice data.$\backslash$nThe proposed models are estimated on Nielsen scanner panel data for$\backslash$nmargarine, peanut butter, yogurt, and liquid detergent using simulated$\backslash$nmaximum likelihood techniques. The empirical results suggest that$\backslash$naccounting for choice dynamics improves both in-sample and out-of-sample$\backslash$nfit. The results indicate that the average consumer is habit persistent$\backslash$nin all the product categories studied. This result is consistent with$\backslash$nthe findings of Kannan and Sanchez (1994), who conducted an aggregate$\backslash$nanalysis of consumer variety seeking behavior across product categories.$\backslash$nHowever, the results obtained in this paper suggest that consumers are$\backslash$nheterogeneous with respect to the processes by which past purchases$\backslash$naffect current purchases.$\backslash$nThese results provide strong evidence for habit persistence and variety$\backslash$nseeking in brand attributes to be the behavioral source of consumer$\backslash$nchoice dynamics in food categories. Thus, consumer tastes (utility$\backslash$nweights) seem to be affected by the attributes of the brands consumed in$\backslash$nthe past. Given the empirical result that a large proportion of$\backslash$nconsumers are habit persistent, this suggests that tastes are reinforced$\backslash$nby the brand attributes consumed in the past.$\backslash$nThe empirical results also show that not accounting for state dependence$\backslash$nin market structure models for panel data may produce misleading$\backslash$nresults, that is, depending on consumer behavior patterns, models that$\backslash$ndo not account for state dependence may distort the true nature of$\backslash$ncompetition among brands. More specifically, the results confirm the$\backslash$nexpectation that if there is habit persistence, that is, if consumer$\backslash$ntastes are reinforced by attributes of brands consumed in the past,$\backslash$nmodels that do not capture this choice dynamics will overestimate the$\backslash$ndistance between (similar) brands.$\backslash$nFurthermore, the policy experiments conducted suggest that (1) static$\backslash$nmodels overestimate the short-run impact of a price cut on the sales of$\backslash$nthe brand on promotion, (2) price cuts hurt the sales of the more$\backslash$nsimilar brands more, and (3) free samples affect relatively less similar$\backslash$nbrands the most.$\backslash$nFinally, this paper studies variety seeking and habit persistence across$\backslash$nbrands over purchase occasions. However, variety seeking behavior may$\backslash$nalso involve the purchase of a portfolio of brands or items at a$\backslash$npurchase occasion. Consumers may buy multiple items knowing that prior$\backslash$nto the next trip they may want to consume different items (Simanson$\backslash$n1990, Walsh 1995). This type of behavior can be modeled within the$\backslash$ncontext of dynamic expected utility maximization with forward-looking$\backslash$nconsumers. The development and estimation of market structure models$\backslash$nthat include forward-looking consumers who maximize expected-utility$\backslash$nover a planning horizon, incorporating their future tastes and needs,$\backslash$nand shopping for an inventory of brands, remain an important future$\backslash$nresearch issue.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes duopolistic price-leadership games in which firms have capacity con- straints. We provide a complete characterization of price leader equilibria under quite general assumptions on demand and for arbitrary capacities. We show that when capacities are in the range where the simultaneous-move price-setting game (with efficiently rationed demand) yields a mixed-strategy solution the large firm is indifferent between being a leader, a follower, or moving simultaneously. The small firm, while indifferent between being a leader and moving simul- taneously, strictly prefers to be a follower. This motivates the discussion of games of timing with ex-post inflexible prices in which the large firm becomes an endogenously determined price leader. We thus provide a game-theoretic model of dominant-firm price leadership. 1.},

abstract = {I analyze price leadership among retail pharmacies in Chile during a case of price war and collusion in hundreds of blockbuster products. The leader during the collusive price increases was the smallest chain, while in the rest of the period the leader was the largest firm. I further show that the order of move of the followers during collusion was highly correlated with the chains' market share in each brand. I estimate the costs of being the collusive leader, which were significant although the difference in prices lasted only a few days. This implies that lead-ership mattered for the firms and that deviation profits in collusion models can be substantial when there are dynamic effects in demand, even when cheating can be detected quickly. I ex-plain leadership by the small chain arguing that the leader was the firm that wanted the most to collude. Hence, price leadership served as a screening mechanism, where the followers de-cided how costly it should be for the leader to truthfully reveal that it was a collusive type. This is consistent with the empirical finding that in brand markets where the largest chain was relatively larger, the price increases in each brand occurred faster.},

In these models, agents choose from a finite number actions and maximize expected discounted utility in a Markov perfect equilibrium. Previous econometric methods estimate the probability distribution of agents' actions in a first stage. In a second step, a finite vector of parame-ters of the period return function are estimated. In this paper, we develop semiparametric estimators for dynamic games allowing for continuous state varaibles and a nonparametric first stage. The estimates of the structural parameters are T 1/2 consistent (where T is the sample size) and asymptotically normal even though the first stage is estimated nonparametrically.

abstract = {It is not unusual in real-life that one has to choose among finitely many alternatives when the merit of each alternative is not per- fectly known. Instead of observing the actual utilities of the alternatives at hand, one typically observes more or less precise signals that are posi- tively correlated with these utilities. In addition, the decision-maker may, at some cost or disutility of effort, choose to increase the precision of these signals, for example by way of a careful study or the hiring of expertise. We here develop a model of such decision problems. We begin by showing that a version of the monotone likelihood-ratio property is sufficient, and also essentially necessary, for the optimality of the heuris- tic decision rule to always choose the alternative with the highest signal. Second, we show that it is not always advantageous to face alternatives with higher utilities, a non-monotonicity result that holds even if the decision-maker optimally chooses the signal precision. We finally estab- lish an operational first-order condition for the optimal precision level in a canonical class of decision-problems, and we show that the optimal precision level may be discontinuous in the precision cost.},

Compared with physical capital, intangible capital adjusts more slowly to changes in investment opportunities. The classic q theory performs better in firms and years with more intangible capital: Total and even physical investment are better explained by Tobin's q and are less sensitive to cash flow. At the macro level, Tobin's q explains intangible investment many times better than physical investment.

We characterize network formation as a simultaneous-move game with incomplete information, where we allow for utility ex-ternalities from indirect friends such as friends-of-friends and friends-in-common. As a consequence the expected utility can be nonlinear in the link choices of an agent. In a network with n members each individual faces a discrete choice problem with 2 n1 overlapping alternatives, which is di¢ cult to solve without simpli{\ldots}cation. We propose a novel method that uses the Legendre transform to express the expected utility as a linear function of the individual link choices. This allows us to derive a closed-form expression for the conditional choice probability (CCP). The closed-form CCP is that for an agent who myopically chooses to establish links or not to the other members of the network. The dependence between the agent's choices is captured by a 'su¢ cient statistic'for this dependence. Using this CCP we propose a two-step estimation proce-dure that requires few assumptions on equilibrium selection, is simple to compute, and provides asymptotically valid estimators for the parameters. The main issue is to show that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator is not dominated by the dependence We are grateful to},

abstract = {Understanding the nature of financial frictions faced by firms is relevant for both monetary and fiscal policy experiments. Empirical investment studies commonly find that proxies for firms' internal funds are significant as explanatory variables, particularly in the Q-theory based regression framework. These findings are often interpreted as evidence of financial frictions. This paper investigates that inference by specifying and estimating a class of dynamic optimization models where imperfectly competitive firms face financial constraints. Market power induces the principal link between investment and internal funds. We find no evidence to support the argument that capital market imperfections contribute to the relationship between investment and profitability. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We develop a new quantile-based panel data framework to study the nature of income persistence and the transmission of income shocks to consumption. Log-earnings are the sum of a general Markovian persistent component and a transitory innova- tion. The persistence of past shocks to earnings is allowed to vary according to the size and sign of the current shock. Consumption is modeled as an age-dependent non-linear function of assets, unobservable tastes, and the two earnings components. We establish the nonparametric identification of the nonlinear earnings process and of the consumption policy rule. Exploiting the enhanced consumption and asset data in recent waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that the earnings process features nonlinear persistence and conditional skewness.We confirm these results us- ing population register data from Norway. We then show that the impact of earnings shocks varies substantially across earnings histories, and that this nonlinearity drives heterogeneous consumption responses. The framework provides new empirical measures of partial insurance in which the transmission of income shocks to consumption varies systematically with assets, the level of the shock, and the history of past shocks.},

@article{Matejka2015a,
abstract = {Individuals must often choose among discrete actions with imper-fect information about their payoffs. Before choosing, they have an opportunity to study the payoffs, but doing so is costly. This creates new choices such as the number of and types of questions to ask. We model these situations using the rational inattention approach to information frictions. We find that the decision maker's optimal strat-egy results in choosing probabilistically in line with a generalized multinomial logit model, which depends both on the actions' true payoffs as well as on prior beliefs. (JEL D11, D81, D83) Economists and psychologists have long known that scarce attention plays an important role in decision making (Simon 1959; Kahneman 1973). In this paper we study the discrete choice behavior of an agent who must allocate his limited atten-tion to the available information about the choice situation. It is not uncommon for one to be faced with a choice among discrete actions with imperfect information about the payoffs of each. Before making a choice, one may have an opportunity to study the actions and their payoffs; however, in most cases it is too costly to investigate to the point where the payoffs are known with certainty. As a result, some uncertainty about the payoffs remains when one chooses among the actions even if complete information was available in principle. Because of this uncertainty, the action that is ultimately chosen may not be the one that provides the highest payoff to the decision maker. Moreover, the noise in the decision process may lead identical individuals to make different choices. In this manner, imperfect information leads choices naturally to contain errors and be probabilistic as opposed to deterministic.},

abstract = {This paper develops a new computationally attractive procedure for estimating dynamic discrete choice models that is applicable to a wide range of dynamic programming models. The proposed procedure can accommodate unobserved state variables that (i) are neither additively separable nor follow generalized extreme value distribution, (ii) are serially cor-related, and (iii) affect the choice set. Our estimation algorithm sequentially updates the parameter estimate and the value function estimate. It builds upon the idea of the itera-tive estimation algorithm proposed by Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002, 2007) but conducts iteration using the value function mapping rather than the policy iteration mapping. Its im-plementation is straightforward in terms of computer programming; unlike the Hotz-Miller type estimators, there is no need to reformulate a fixed point mapping in the value func-tion space as that in the space of probability distributions. It is also applicable to estimate models with unobserved heterogeneity. We analyze the convergence property of our sequen-tial algorithm and derive the conditions for its convergence. We develop an approximated procedure which reduces computational cost substantially without deteriorating the conver-gence rate. We further extend our sequential procedure for estimating dynamic programming models with an equilibrium constraint, which include dynamic game models and dynamic macroeconomic models.},

In 1980, average markups start to rise from 18{\%} above marginal cost to 67{\%} now. There is no strong pattern across industries, though markups tend to be higher, across all sectors of the economy, in smaller firms and most of the increase is due to an increase within industry. We do see a notable change in the distribution of markups with the increase exclusively due to a sharp increase in high markup firms. We then evaluate the macroeconomic implications of an increase in average market power, which can account for a number of secular trends in the last 3 decades: 1. decrease in labor share; 2. decrease in capital share; 3. decrease in low skill wages; 4. decrease in labor force participation; 5. decrease in labor flows; 6. decrease in migration rates; 7. slowdown in aggregate output.},

abstract = {“Demand analysis” refers largely to the study of commodity demands by consumers, most usually based on aggregate data but occasionally, and more so recently, on cross-sections or even panels of households. This chapter discusses the links between conventional demand analysis and such topics as labor supply, the consumption function, rationing, index numbers, equivalence scales, and consumer surplus. The econometric analysis of demand under conditions of rationing or quantity constraints is discussed in the chapter. The chapter discusses intertemporal demand analysis, including the analysis of the consumption function and of durable goods, the choice over qualities, and the links between demand analysis and welfare economics—particularly as it concerns the measurement of consumer surplus, cost-of-living index numbers, and the costs of children},

abstract = {The US airline industry went through tremendous turmoil in the early 2000s, with four major bankruptcies, two major mergers, and various changes in network structure. This paper presents a structural model of the industry, and estimates the impact of demand and supply changes on profitability. Compared with 1999, we find that, in 2006, air-travel demand was 8 percent more price sensitive, passengers displayed a stronger preference for nonstop flights, and changes in marginal cost significantly favored nonstop flights. Together with the expansion of low-cost carriers, they explain more than 80 percent of legacy carriers' variable profit reduction. (JEL L13, L25, L93)},

abstract = {Understanding the health impact of air pollution and consumer willingness to pay for clean air (WTP) is critical for understanding the benefit of environmental regulations. Based on the universe of credit and debit card transactions in China from 2013-2015, this paper quantifies the health impacts of PM 2.5 and estimates consumer WTP for improved air quality. To address potential endogeneity in air quality, we construct an instrumental variable by leveraging the spatial spillovers of PM 2.5 due to long-range transport. Our analysis shows that PM 2.5 has significant impacts on health spending in both short term (within a week) and longer term (within three months). A reduction of 10 µg/m 3 in daily PM 2.5 would lead to total annual savings of at least 75 billion yuan ({\$}11 billion) in health spending in China. The estimates suggest a lower bound of annual household WTP of {\$}25 for a 10 µg/m 3 reduction in PM 2.5 . While an increase in PM 2.5 would lead to a modest reduction in non-health spending in the short-term, likely due to avoidance behavior, there is no longer-term impact on these types of transactions.},

We develop a dynamic model in which a firm's exports in each market may depend on how similar it is to its home country (gravity) and to its previous export destinations (extended gravity). Given the large number of export paths from which forward-looking firms may choose, we use a moment inequality approach to structurally estimate our model. We conclude that extended gravity reduces firms' cost of foreign market entry by 27{\%} to 40{\%}.},

Currently , Monte - Carlo is a popular technique for computer Go . In a previous study , Monte - Carlo was associated with domain - dependent knowledge in the Go - playing program Indigo . In 2003 , a 3x3 pattern database was built manually . This paper explores the possibility of using reinforcement learning to automatically tune the 3x3 pattern urgencies . On 9x9 boards , within the Monte - Carlo architecture of Indigo , the result obtained by our automatic learning experiments is better than the manual method by a 3 - point margin on average , which is satisfactory . Although the current results are promising on 19x19 boards , obtaining strictly positive results with such a large size remains to be done .},

abstract = {Abstract: Technological change and deregulation have caused a major restructuring telecommunications equipment industry over the last two decades. Our empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incumbents. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different estimates of production function coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures, and that the productivity increases that followed deregulation were primarily a result of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.

@article{Low2017,
abstract = {T he aim of this paper is to discuss the role of structural economic models in empirical analysis and policy design. This approach offers some valuable payoffs, but also imposes some costs. Structural economic models focus on distinguishing clearly between the objec-tive function of the economic agents and their opportunity sets as defined by the economic environment. The key features of such an approach at its best are a tight connection with a theoretical framework alongside a clear link with the data that will allow one to understand how the model is identified. The set of assumptions under which the model inferences are valid should be clear: indeed, the clarity of the assumptions is what gives value to structural models. The central payoff of a structural econometric model is that it allows an empir-ical researcher to go beyond the conclusions of a more conventional empirical study that provides reduced-form causal relationships. Structural models define how outcomes relate to preferences and to relevant factors in the economic envi-ronment, identifying mechanisms that determine outcomes. Beyond this, they},

Applications of this framework include the analysis of game-theoretic models, revealed preference restrictions, regressions with missing and corrupted data, auction models, structural quantile regressions, and asset pricing models. Specifically, we provide estimators and confidence regions for the set of minimizers OI of an econometric criterion function Q(O). In applications, the criterion functio embodies testable restrictions on economic models. A parameter value 0 that describe an economic model satisfies these restrictions if Q(0) attains its minimum at this value Interest therefore focuses on the set of minimizers, called the identified set. We use the inversion of the sample analog, Q,(O), of the population criterion, Q(0), to construc estimators and confidence regions for the identified set, and develop consistency, rates of convergence, and inference results for these estimators and regions. To derive thes results, we develop methods for analyzing the asymptotic properties of sample criterio functions under set identification.},

abstract = {We develop a tractable and applicable dynamic model of network formation with transfers in the presence of externalities. Our primary application is the estimation of primitives and prediction of counterfactual outcomes in bilateral oligopoly and buyer-seller networks. The framework takes as primitives each agent's static profits, and provides the equilibrium recurrent class of networks and negotiated transfers. Importantly, agents anticipate future changes to the network, and links may be costly to form, maintain, or break. We detail the computation and es-timation of a Markov-Perfect equilibrium in this environment, and highlight the approach using simulated data motivated by insurer-hospital negotiations. We explore the impact of hospital mergers on negotiated payments, insurer premiums, and consumer welfare, and demonstrate how accounting for dynamics yields substantively different predictions than traditional static approaches.},

The model combines elements from network theory and from the politico-economic theory of conflict. We obtain a closed-form characterization of the Nash equilibrium. Using the equilibrium conditions, we perform an em-pirical analysis using data on the Second Congo War, a conflict that involves many groups in a complex network of informal alliances and rivalries. The estimates of the fighting externalities are then used to infer the extent to which the conflict intensity can be reduced through (i) dismantling specific fighting groups involved in the conflict; (ii) weapon embargoes; (iii) inter-ventions aimed at pacifying animosity among groups. Finally, with the aid of a random utility model, we study how policy shocks can induce a reshaping of the network structure.},

We identify two potentially important peer cultures: one that stigmatizes effort (thus, where it is " smart to be cool ") and one that rewards ability (where it is " cool to be smart "). We build a model that shows that either may lead to lower educational effort when effort and performance are potentially observable by peers. We design a field experiment to both test whether students are influenced by these concerns in general, and to separately test which of these concerns they are responding more to. We implement the experiment in two different settings: a high school in a low income, high minority share area and two high schools in higher income, lower minority share areas. In both settings, fewer students sign up for a lottery to get complimentary access to an online SAT prep package when they are unsure that their decision would stay completely private from their classmates. We further show that this behavior is consistent with a greater concern for hiding effort in the lower income, higher minority share school, and a greater concern with hiding low ability in the higher income, lower minority share schools.},

Initially, high-dimensional data are projected into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using random projections. Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclic monotonicity moment inequalities implied by the multinomial choice model; the estimation procedure is semi-parametric and does not require explicit distributional assumptions to be made regarding the random utility errors. Our procedure is justified via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma – the pairwise distances between data points are preserved through random projections. The estimator works well in simulations and in an application to a supermarket scanner dataset.},

abstract = {This paper provides a directed search model designed to explain the residual part of wage variation left over after the impact of education and other observable worker characteristics have been removed. Workers have private information about their characteristics at the time they apply for jobs. Firms value these characteristics differently and can observe them once workers apply. They hire the worker they most prefer. However, the characteristics are not contractible, so firms cannot condition their wages on them. This paper shows how to extend arguments from directed search to handle this, allowing for arbitrary distributions of worker and firm types. The model is used to provide a functional relationship that ties together the wage distribution and the wage–duration function. This relationship provides a testable implication of the model. This relationship suggests a common property of wage distributions that guarantees that workers who leave unemployment at the highest wages also have the shortest unemployment duration. This is in strict contrast to the usual (and somewhat implausible) directed search story in which high wages are always accompanied by higher probability of unemployment.},

A higher-type agent benefits more from providing such objective, albeit imprecise, "proof" for the market, but may also gain less from learning about his/her productivity. When the latter effect dominates the former for the very high types, the equilibrium exhibits countersignaling: very high and low types pool on refraining from signaling, and only the medium types signal.

Econometrica. 63 (4), 841–890], which introduces a common demand shock into an aggregated random coefficient logit model. A full likelihood approach is possible with a specification of the distribution of the common demand shock. We introduce a reparameterization of the covariance matrix to improve the performance of the random walk Metropolis for covariance parameters. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach with both actual and simulated data. Sampling experiments show that our approach performs well relative to the GMM estimator even in the presence of a mis-specified shock distribution. We view our approach as useful for those who are willing to trade off one additional distributional assumption for increased efficiency in estimation.},

abstract = {We use employee-level panel data from a single firm to explore the possibility that individuals may select insurance coverage in part based on their anticipated behavioral (" moral hazard ") response to insurance, a phenomenon we label " selection on moral hazard. " Using a model of plan choice and medical utilization, we present evidence of heterogenous moral hazard as well as selection on it, and explore some of its implications. For example, we show that, at least in our context, abstracting from selection on moral hazard could lead to overestimates of the spending reduction associated with introducing a high-deductible health insurance option. (JEL D82, G22, I13, J32) Economic analysis of market failure in insurance markets tends to analyze selec-tion and moral hazard as distinct phenomena. In this paper, we explore the potential for selection on moral hazard in insurance markets. By this we mean the possibility that moral hazard effects are heterogenous across individuals, and that individuals' selection of insurance coverage is affected by their anticipated behavioral response to coverage. We examine these issues empirically in the context of employer-provided health insurance in the United States. Specifically, we break down the general},

California hospitals in 1995 face an average price elasticity of demand of –4.85. Not-for-profit hospitals face less elastic demand and act as if they have lower marginal costs. Their prices are lower than for-profits, but markups are higher. We simulate the effects of the 1997 merger of two hospital chains. In San Luis Obispo County, where the merger creates a near monopoly, prices rise by up to 53{\%}, and the predicted price increase would not be substantially smaller were the chains not-for-profits.},

To measure the magnitude of this quality-quantity tradeoff, we estimate a model of dialysis provision that explicitly incorporates a center's unob-servable and endogenous choice of treatment quality while allowing for unobserved differences in productivity across centers. We find that a center that reduces its quality standards such that its expected rate of septic infections increases by 1 percentage point can increase its patient load by 1.6 percent, holding productivity, capital, and labor fixed; this corresponds to an elasticity of quantity with respect to quality of -0.2. Notably, our approach provides estimates of pro-ductivity that control for differences in quality, whereas traditional methods would misattribute lower-quality care to greater productivity.},

Standard identification arguments break down if this condition is violated. This paper shows that treatment effects remain partially identified under weak assumptions on individuals' behavior in this case. We derive sharp bounds on causal parameters for both sharp and fuzzy designs, and show how additional structure can be used to further narrow the bounds. We use our methods to study the disincentive effect of unemployment insurance on (formal) reemployment in Brazil, where we find evidence of manipulation at an eligibility cutoff. Our bounds remain informative, despite the fact that manipulation has a sizable effect on our estimates of causal parameters.},

Our work addresses a central question facing the hospitality industry: to what extent are Airbnb stays serving as substitutes for hotel stays, and what is the impact on the bottom line of affected hotels? Our focus is the state of Texas, where we identify Airbnb's impact by exploiting significant spatiotemporal variation in the patterns of adoption across city-level markets. Using a dataset we collected spanning all Airbnb listings in Texas and a decade-long panel of quarterly tax revenue for all Texas hotels, we develop a nuanced estimate of Airbnb's material impact on hotel revenues. Our baseline estimate is that a 1{\%} increase in Airbnb listings in Texas results in a 0.05{\%} decrease in quarterly hotel revenues, an estimate compounded by Airbnb's rapid growth. To further isolate Airbnb's impact, we employ hotel segments that consumers are less likely to substitute for Airbnb stays as additional control groups. We find that the impacts are distributed unevenly across the industry, with lower-end hotels and hotels not catering to business travelers being the most affected. Finally, by simulating various regulatory interventions informed by current events, such as limiting Airbnb hosts to a single listing, we find only a moderate mitigating impact on hotel revenues.

We thank Smith Travel Research (STR) for sharing data with us. We are also indebted to Flavio Esposito for motivating us to investigate Airbnb and for his contributions to our earlier research on the topic.},

abstract = {We propose a two-sided model with two competing Internet platforms, and a continuum of Content Providers (CP's). We study the effect of a net neutrality regulation on capacity investments in the market for Internet access, and on innovation in the market for content. Under the alternative discriminatory regime, platforms charge a priority fee to those CP's which are willing to deliver their content on a fast lane. We find that under discrimination, investments in broadband capacity and content innovation are both higher than under net neutrality. Total welfare increases, though the discriminatory regime is not always beneficial to the platforms as it can intensify competition for subscribers. As platforms have a unilateral incentive to switch to the discriminatory regime, a prisoner's dilemma can arise. We also consider the possibility of sabotage, and show that it can only emerge, with adverse welfare effects, under discrimination. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Estimating consumer surplus is challenging because it requires identification of the entire demand curve. We rely on Uber's " surge " pricing algorithm and the richness of its individual level data to first estimate demand elasticities at several points along the demand curve. We then use these elasticity estimates to estimate consumer surplus. Using almost 50 million individual-level observations and a regression discontinuity design, we estimate that in 2015 the UberX service generated about {\$}2.9 billion in consumer surplus in the four U.S. cities included in our analysis. For each dollar spent by consumers, about {\$}1.60 of consumer surplus is generated. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the overall consumer surplus generated by the UberX service in the United States in 2015 was {\$}6.8 billion.},

abstract = {Ever since the seminal work of Stigler (1962), economists have recognized that information in markets is costly to acquire and can lead to “search frictions”. The remarkable growth in online search has substantially lowered the cost of information acquisition. Despite this, there is little evidence concerning the extent to which this has altered the search process and raised overall matching efficiency. To address this issue, we analyze the expansion of the website "Craigslist", which allows users to post job ads and apartment and housing rental ads at virtually no cost. Exploiting the sharp geographic and temporal variation in the availability of online search, induced by Craigslist, we produce three key findings: Craigslist significantly lowered classified job advertisements in newspapers, caused a significant reduction in the apartment and housing rental vacancy rate, and had no effect on the unemployment rate.},

abstract = {A t a local Best Buy, a child places a new Sony PlayStation 3 on the cashier's counter while the parents dig out their Visa card. The gaming system and the payment card may appear to have little connection other than this purchase. However, these two items share an important characteristic that is generating a series of economic insights and has important implications for stra-tegic decision making and economic policymaking. Both video game systems and payment cards are examples of two-sided markets. Broadly speaking, a two-sided market is one in which 1) two sets of agents interact through an intermediary or platform, and 2) the decisions of each set of agents affects the outcomes of the other set of agents, typically through an externality. In the case of a video game system, the intermediary is the console producer—Sony in the scenario above—while the two sets of agents are consumers and video game developers. Neither consumers nor game developers will be interested in the PlayStation if the other party is not. Similarly, a successful payment card requires both consumer usage and merchant acceptance, where both con-sumers and merchants value each others' participation. Many more products fit into this paradigm, such as search engines, newspapers, and almost any advertiser-supported media (examples in which consumers often negatively value, rather than positively value, the participation of the other side), as well as most software or title-based operating systems and consumer electronics. Malls which seek retailers and consumers, convention organizers which seek buyers and sellers, dating ser-vices which seek men and women, and The Journal of Economic Perspectives which seeks content and readership, all experience the economics of two-sided markets. The multi-sided nature of many Internet and high-technology markets, as well as new payment systems and media outlets, suggest that two-sided and multi-sided markets are becoming increasingly important. This paper seeks to explain what two-sided markets are and why they interest economists. I discuss the strategies that firms typically consider, and I highlight a number of puzzling outcomes from the perspective of the economics of two-sided markets. Finally, I consider the implications for public policy, particularly antitrust and regulatory policy, where there have been a number of recent issues involving media, computer operating systems, and payment cards.},

Therefore, we do not know whether copyright protection now provides weaker incentives to bring forth new products. This paper assesses the quality of new recorded music since Napster was established in 1999. First, I create an index of high-quality music from critics' retrospective lists. Next, I rely on music sales and airplay data, using the idea that if one vintage's music is better than another's, its superior quality should generate higher sales or greater airplay through time, after accounting for depreciation. I find no evidence of a reduction in the quality of music released since 1999, and the two usage-based indices suggest an increase since then. Researchers and policy makers thinking about the strength of copyright protection should supplement their attention to producer surplus with concern for consumer surplus.},

The conditions under which the request is justified, from the listener's point of view, depend on the values of two aspects. The values of the aspects are known only to the speaker and the listener can check the value of at most one. A mechanism specifies a set of messages that the speaker can send and a rule that determines the listener's response, namely, which aspect he checks and whether he accepts or rejects the speaker's request. We study mechanisms that maximize the probability that the listener accepts the request when it is justified and rejects the request when it is unjustified, given that the speaker maximizes the probability that his request is accepted. We show that a simple optimal mechanism exists and can be found by solving a linear programming problem in which the set of constraints is derived from what we call the L-principle.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the identi{\ldots}cation and estimation of dynamic games when players' beliefs about other players' actions are biased, i.e., beliefs do not represent the probability distribution of the actual behavior of other players conditional on the information available. First, we show that an exclusion restriction, typically used to identify empirical games, provides testable nonparametric restrictions of the null hypothesis of equilibrium beliefs in dynamic games with either {\ldots}nite or in{\ldots}nite horizon. We use this result to construct a simple Likelihood Ratio test of equilibrium beliefs. Second, we prove that this exclusion restriction, together with consistent estimates of beliefs at two points in the support of the variable involved in the exclusion restriction, is su¢ cient for nonparametric point-identi{\ldots}cation of players' belief functions as well as useful functions of payo¤s. Third, we propose a simple two-step estimation method. We illustrate our model and methods using both Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application of a dynamic game of store location by retail chains. The key conditions for the identi{\ldots}cation of beliefs and payo¤s in our application are the following: (a) the previous year's network of stores of the competitor does not have a direct e¤ect on the pro{\ldots}t of a {\ldots}rm, but the {\ldots}rm's own network of stores at previous year does a¤ect its pro{\ldots}t because the existence of sunk entry costs and economies of density in these costs; and (b) {\ldots}rms'beliefs are unbiased in those markets that are close, in a geographic sense, to the opponent's network of stores, though beliefs are unrestricted, and potentially biased, for unexplored markets which are farther away from the competitors'network. Our estimates show signi{\ldots}cant evidence of biased beliefs. Furthermore, imposing the restriction of unbiased beliefs generates a substantial attenuation bias in the estimate of competition e¤ects.},

abstract = {What is the role of structural estimation in behavioral economics? I discuss advantages, and limitations, of the work in Structural Behavioral Economics. I also cover common modeling choices and how to get started. Among the advantages, I argue that structural estimation builds on, and expands, a classical behavioral tool, simple calibrations, and that it benefits from the presence of a few parsimonious behavioral models which can be taken to the data. Estimation is also well suited for experimental work, common in behavioral economics, as it can lead to improvements in the experimental design. In addition, at a time where policy implications of behavioral work are increasingly discussed, it is important to ground these policy implications in (estimated) models. Structural work, however, has important limitations, which are relevant to its behavioral applications. Estimation takes much longer and the extra degree of complexity can make it difficult to know which of a series of assumptions is driving the results. For related reasons, it is also easy to overreach with the welfare implications. Taking this into account, I provide a partial how-to guide to structural behavioral economics, covering: (i) the choice of estimation method; (ii) the modeling of heterogeneity; (iii) identification and sensitivity. Finally, I discuss common issues for the estimation of leading behavioral models. I illustrate this discussion with selected coverage of existing work in the literature.},

abstract = {Often researchers find parametric models restrictive and sensitive to deviations from the parametric specifications; semi-nonparametric models are more flexible and robust, but lead to other complications such as introducing infinite-dimensional parameter spaces that may not be compact and the optimization problem may no longer be well-posed. The method of sieves provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense in the original space and the resulting optimization problem becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without) endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate prior information and constraints, often derived from economic theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity, multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in semi-nonparametric models, typically with optimal convergence rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of semi-nonparametric econometric models via the method of sieves. We present some general results on the large sample properties of the sieve estimates, including consistency of the sieve extremum estimates, convergence rates of the sieve M-estimates, pointwise normality of series estimates of regression functions, root-n asymptotic normality and efficiency of sieve estimates of smooth functionals of infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the general results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is a renewed interest in the size of labour supply elasticities and the discrepancy between micro and macro estimates. Recent contributions have stressed the distinction between changes in labour supply at the extensive and the intensive margin. In this paper, we stress the importance of individual heterogeneity and aggregation problems. At the intensive margins, simple specifications that seem to fit the data give rise to non linear expressions that do not aggregate in a simple fashion. At the extensive margin, aggregate changes in participation are likely to depend on the cross sectional distribution of state variables when a shock hits and, therefore, are likely to be history dependent. We tackle these aggregation issues directly by specifying a life cycle model to explain female labour supply in the US and estimate its various components. We estimate the parameters of different component of the model. Our results indicate that (i) at the intensive margin, Marshallian and Hicksian elasticities are very heterogeneous and, on average, relatively large; (ii) Frisch elasticities are, as implied by the theory, even larger; (iii) aggregate labour supply elasticities seem to vary over the business cycle, being larger during recessions.},

abstract = {We specify and estimate a life-cycle labour supply model that expands on earlier work by simultaneously including human capital accumulation, saving and bequests, an active extensive margin, a realistic specification of the progressive tax structure and the Social Security system, and an accounting for private pensions and health expenditures. By incorporating all these features, we develop new insights into how taxes affect life-cycle labour supply. For instance, we find that labour supply elasticities vary in important ways with age, education and the tax structure itself. We also show how human capital affects elasticities differently on the intensive versus extensive margins. In this article, we specify and estimate a life-cycle labour supply model that incorporates many key features of the US economic environment that have not heretofore been unified in a single framework. 1 These features include: human capital accumulation, an active extensive margin, saving and bequests, a realistic specification of the Social Security system, an accounting for private pensions and health expenditures, and a realistic specification of the progressive tax structure. By accounting for all these features, we develop new insights into how taxes affect life-cycle labour supply. For instance, we find that labour supply elasticities vary in important ways with age, education and the tax structure itself. Our work was originally motivated by the well-known controversy over the magnitude of labour supply elasticities. The conventional wisdom among economists, at least until recently, was that Frisch and Hicks elasticities are quite small, at least for men (MaCurdy, 1981; Browning et al., 1985; Altonji, 1986; Blundell and Walker, 1986). Recently, this consensus has come under attack from two directions: A line of work starting with Imai and Keane (2004), and represented recently by Keane (2016), argues that the failure of most of the male labour supply literature to account for human capital has led to severe downward bias in Frisch and Hicks elasticity estimates. At the same time, a line of research dating back to Rogerson (1988) argues that failure to account for the extensive margin (participation decisions) led the male labour supply literature to understate labour supply elasticities.

abstract = {The response of aggregate labor supply to various changes in the economic environment is central to many economic issues, including the optimal design of tax policies. Whereas the earlier literature often concluded that aggregate labor supply elasticities were small, we argue that recent work using structural models and micro data credibly supports large aggregate elasticities. We focus on three issues. First, earlier analyses abstracted from several key features, including human capital accumulation, that severely negatively biased estimates of a key preference parameter. Second, failure to understand that aggregate labor supply adjustments can occur along both the hours per worker and employment margins has led economists to misinterpret the implications of preference parameters for aggregate labor supply. Third, structural estimation of models that feature choice along the extensive margin using micro data typically finds large responses.},

@techreport{Imai2004,
abstract = {We solve and estimate a dynamic model that allows agents to optimally choose their labor hours and consumption and that allows for both human capital accumulation and savings. Estimation results and simulation exercises indicate that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is much higher than the conventional estimates and the downward bias comes from the omission of the human capital accumulation effect. The human capital accumulation effect renders the life-cycle path of the shadow wage relatively flat, even though wages increase with age. Hence, a rather flat life-cycle labor supply path can be reconciled with a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution.},
